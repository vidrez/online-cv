career-profile:
  title: Who am I?
  summary: Hi! I'm Sergiu, welcome to my profile ☺️
  details: |
    I am a Full-stack developer that in the years has expanded his horizons into Cybersecurity, especially in web application security.

    I take pride in my work and always strive to deliver my best, pushing beyond expectations to achieve my goals. I am a quick learner, eager to embrace new challenges and continuously grow.
    If you believe we could collaborate or if you want to discuss exciting opportunities, feel free to reach out. Cheers!
education:
  title: Education
  info:
  - degree: MSc in Cybersecurity
    university: University of Padova
    time: 2020 - Present (est. 2026)
    details: |
      The course offers a mostly theoretical yet diverse curriculum in Cybersecurity, with topics such as Ethical Hacking, Biometrics and Risk Management. 
      Initially I had chosen this path as a way to broaden my knowledge in web application security, and then I quickly realized how vast the Cybersecurity panorama really is. 
      Over time I have merged what I learned as a developer and an IT security specialist; I believe the two are complementary and can benefit each other. 
      Studies continue to this day alongside my professional career. 
  - degree: BSc in Computer Science
    university: University of Udine
    time: 2016 - 2019
    details: |
      The programme combined computer science and communications courses, leaving the choice to the student on which specialization to focus and earn the degree. 
      This option was chosen over a more traditional path since I believe that, while having a strong technical knowledge is vital, the tools that 
      I develop serve people, therefore communication is as important.

experiences:
  title: Work Experience
  info:
  - role: IT Security Trainee & Digital Security Specialist
    time: Jul 2023 - Jun 2025
    company: European Central Bank, Frankfurt am Main
    details: |
      Starting first as a Trainee and later as a Specialist in the SOC team, my main responsibility involved maintaining
      and further developing an internal tool designed to manage the complete lifecycle of security detections, from
      ideation, through deployment to the SIEM, and ultimately retirement.
        - The technology stack primarily consisted of Django, Gitlab CI/CD tools, Vue.js, Bootstrap and Docker.
        - DevSecOps practices were implemented by having unit testing, static code analysis, linting, package auditing and SBOM analysis to name a few.
        - I was responsible for migrating the tool to a cloud-native environment on AWS using Terraform (IaC).
        - Had the opportunity to coordinate an international working group that involved multiple partner institutions in the context of a joint project effort.
        - Additionally I supported my team in various other tasks with different degrees of involvement, such as dashboard development in Splunk, automating incident responses through the SOAR platform, detection engineering and investigative work.
  - role: Full Stack Web Developer
    time: Jan 2020 - May 2023
    company: Prysma S.r.l., Pordenone
    details: |
      The development team consisted of just two people, so in addition to core development tasks, operational responsibilities related to DevOps were also undertaken.
        - I was involved in all phases of the software development lifecycle across multiple products, including client support and training.
        - The main technology stack was composed by Laravel, Vue.js, MySQL, Bootstrap and/or Tailwind CSS depending on the project.
        - Operational duties involved managing our Linux based hosting environments via either Plesk or command line in order to patch the systems, configure the firewall, manage the IDS/IPS and WAF rules, set the backup plans, configure and monitor the logs of system and apps.
        - I started working with AWS, particularly in designing and implementing a translation system using AWS Lambda, Translate, and API Gateway, along with planning the migration of existing platforms to a cloud-native environment.
  - role: Intern Web Developer
    time: Feb 2019 - Apr 2019
    company: W3design, Pordenone
    details: |
      In the brief time I worked here as an Intern I’ve learned the basics of web development by creating a small application in Laravel, which later on was used as the subject of my bachelor degree thesis.
